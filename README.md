- 👋 Hi, I’m @djmerrit, aka Italo Gomes, an old school software architecture/developer who started in software development in old Z80/6502 days. I am always looking for new technologies and improvements for my career.
- 👀 I’m currently interested in technologies that can improve people's life, anything that may become the bridge between the abstract idea and its realization.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning about financials and crypto currencies for personal use, but I also like artificial intelligence a lot.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any philanthropic project using artificial intelligence or any practical/classical approaches. I prefer those focused in health improvement or desease cures.
- 📫 You can contact me using my personal e-mail: italogomes.etc-at-outlook.com.
